A Few things of node for coding standards
1. All classes should be preceded by a summary block outlining what the point of the class is
2. All methods should have a header block like outlined in MainWindow.xaml.cs for example
3. Do not use the this keyword unless necessary
4. Never use the var keyword, always declare the type
5. Classes should be broken up into the Model View Controller structure
5a. That means that the view should never do computations
5b. That means the controller should never display anything or compute much except for actions
5c. That means the model shouldn't handle user actions
5d. The 3 components in MVC should be in separate classes
6. When working in general, keep code closed for modification but open for extension
7. Avoid duplicate code at all costs
8. Unless necessary, classes should serve one purpose
9. Methods should do one specific thing
9a. If you need a method to complete some overarching task, break up the code into smaller methods and call in the main one
10. Any given method should be able to be viewed on a normal screen size (dont make them too long)
11. Stray away from having lines of code from being super long
12. If you have mutliple lines that serve a single purpose and they are short enough, you can combine them into one one
12a. For example, you can have a line that is something like: arr[0] = 1; arr[1] = 5;
13. Objects that are needed in two places should be referenced, not duplicated (especially custom object types)
14. Data should be private unless necessary
15. Precede object data members with m_ (i.e. m_myArr)
16. For private data types that need to be accessed elsewhere, create a public property to access them
17. If there is a need to get data in its raw type and a string, append a V to the end of the property name for the raw type
17a. i.e. (string) num and (int) numV being public properties for the private int m_num
18. Classes should be capitalized fully while variables should be in camel case
